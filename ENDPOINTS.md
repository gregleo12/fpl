## 🔍 Endpoint Details

### GET /api/league/[id]

**Parameters:**
- `id` (path) - League ID (e.g., 804742)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "league": {
    "id": 804742,
    "name": "Dedoume FPL",
    "standings": [...],
    "managers": [...]
  }
}
```

---

### GET /api/league/[id]/fixtures/[gw]

Returns H2H fixtures for a specific gameweek.

**Parameters:**
- `id` (path) - League ID
- `gw` (path) - Gameweek number (1-38)

**Response:**
```json
{

    }
  ]
}
```

**Data Source Logic:**
- `status === 'completed'` → Uses `manager_gw_history` for scores
- `status === 'in_progress'` → Uses FPL API live data
- `status === 'upcoming'` → Returns 0-0 scores

---

### GET /api/league/[id]/stats/gameweek/[gw]

Returns detailed statistics for a gameweek.

**Response includes:**
- Captain picks
- Chips played
- Hits taken
- Points on bench
- Top performers

**Data Source Logic:**
- Completed GW → Database (K-27 tables)
- Live GW → FPL API

---

### GET /api/league/[id]/stats/gameweek/[gw]/rankings

      "team_name": "Team Name",
      "points": 104
    }
  ]
}
```

**Features:**
- Rankings based purely on GW points (not H2H results)
- Handles ties correctly - managers with equal points get the same rank
- Ordered by points DESC, then player_name ASC

## 🚨 Common Issues

### Endpoint Returns 0 Values
Check if `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` is present in the route file.

### CORS Errors
Use `/api/fpl-proxy` to proxy FPL API calls from the frontend.

### Slow Response
- Check if endpoint is fetching from FPL API when it should use database
- Add database caching for frequently accessed data

### Scores Showing 0 for Completed GWs
Verify the endpoint fetches from all required K-27 tables:
- `manager_picks` - Team selections
- `manager_gw_history` - Points and transfer costs
- `manager_chips` - Active chip

See `src/lib/scoreCalculator.ts:75-119` for the correct pattern.

---

## 📝 Adding New Endpoints

When adding a new endpoint:

1. Create route file in appropriate `src/app/api/` directory
2. Add `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` if using database
3. Document in this ENDPOINTS.md file
4. Add to CLAUDE.md if it's a critical endpoint
5. Update tests if applicable
