## Current Version

**v4.5.4** (January 2, 2026)

K-163L: Fixed schedule luck to use progressive averages instead of final season averages. This ensures the TIMING of when you face opponents matters - facing someone during a slump vs when they're hot. The fix resolves the issue where everyone showed scheduleLuck = 0 after facing all opponents once.

See [VERSION_HISTORY.md](./VERSION_HISTORY.md) for full details.
