## Current Version

**v4.5.8** (January 2, 2026)

K-163N CRITICAL Fix: Fixed League Rankings table (Rank Tab) to use the SAME 4-component weighted luck formula as the Luck Leaderboard. Was using wrong calculation (simple GW sum) instead of proper season luck index. Jean Boes now correctly shows +40.0 instead of +13. All luck values across the app now match perfectly.

See [VERSION_HISTORY.md](./VERSION_HISTORY.md) for full details.
