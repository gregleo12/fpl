## Current Version

**v4.3.22** (December 29, 2025)

BUG FIX: Fixed Rivals H2H showing 0-0 for GW18. Enhanced `checkDatabaseHasGWData()` to validate BOTH manager data AND player stats. K-108c needs both tables - if `player_gameweek_stats` has zeros, all scores are zero. Now uses two-stage validation matching team routes pattern.

See [VERSION_HISTORY.md](./VERSION_HISTORY.md) for full details.
