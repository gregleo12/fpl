## Current Version

**v4.3.24** (December 29, 2025)

BUG FIX: Fixed Classic Pts leaderboard showing "Unknown" for all manager names. Type mismatch in Map keys - PostgreSQL entry_id wasn't being consistently converted to numbers. Also fixed display to show top 3 preview items instead of 5 to match other leaderboard cards.

See [VERSION_HISTORY.md](./VERSION_HISTORY.md) for full details.
