## Current Version

**v4.7.7** (January 3, 2026)

**CRITICAL FIX: GW20 Live Status Detection** - Fixed critical bug where Rivals H2H section didn't recognize live gameweeks. Changed status checks from 'in_progress' to 'live' to match API response. Now correctly shows live modals with real-time player data during live gameweeks instead of forecast modals.

See [VERSION_HISTORY.md](./VERSION_HISTORY.md) for full details.
