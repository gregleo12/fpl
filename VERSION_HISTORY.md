## v3.6.2 - CRITICAL: Fix liveMatch.ts Provisional Bonus (K-106a Part 2) (Dec 23, 2025)

**Critical Bug Fix:** liveMatch.ts was still adding provisional bonus for completed fixtures, causing H2H Modal to show incorrect scores.

### Problem

K-106a fixed the My Team pitch, but H2H Modal (Live Match) still showed inflated scores:
- **My Team pitch**: Haaland TC showed 48 pts ✅ (correct)
- **H2H Modal**: Haaland TC showed 57 pts ❌ (wrong)
- **GW PTS tile**: Showed 95 instead of 97 ❌
- **H2H cards**: Showed 95-89 instead of 97-89 ❌

### Root Cause

`liveMatch.ts` `getBonusInfo()` function (line 34-36) was returning `officialBonus` for finished fixtures:
```typescript
if (fixture.finished) {
  return { bonusPoints: officialBonus };  // ❌ WRONG!
}
```

This bonus was then **added** to `total_points` which already included it, causing double-counting.

**Example:**
1. Haaland `rawCaptainPoints` = 16 (includes 3 bonus)
2. `captainOfficialBonus` = 3
3. `getBonusInfo()` returns 3
4. `captainPointsWithBonus` = 16 + 3 = 19 ❌
5. `captainPoints` = 19 × 3 = 57 ❌

### Solution

Changed `getBonusInfo()` to return 0 for finished fixtures since bonus is already in `total_points`:
```typescript
// K-106a: If fixture is finished, bonus is already in total_points - return 0
if (fixture.finished) {
  return { bonusPoints: 0 };
}
```

### Files Modified
- `src/lib/liveMatch.ts` - Fixed `getBonusInfo()` to return 0 for finished fixtures (lines 33-37)

### Impact
- ✅ H2H Modal now shows correct scores for completed fixtures
- ✅ Captain multipliers apply to correct base
- ✅ No impact on live/in-progress fixtures (still calculate provisional bonus)

### Testing Required
- Verify H2H Modal shows Haaland TC at 48 pts (not 57)
- Verify GW PTS tile shows correct totals
- Verify H2H cards show correct scores
- Check Railway logs for K-106b debug output

## v3.6.1 - CRITICAL: Fix Provisional Bonus for Completed GWs (K-106a) (Dec 23, 2025)

**Critical Bug Fix:** Provisional bonus points were being added to player scores even for completed gameweeks, causing significant point inflation.

### Problem

For completed GWs, the FPL API's `total_points` field already includes official bonus points. The app was incorrectly adding provisional bonus on top of this, double-counting bonus for any player who earned it.

**Example:**
- Haaland GW17 official points: 16 (includes 3 bonus already)
- App calculated: 16 + 3 provisional = 19 ❌
- With Triple Captain: 19 × 3 = 57 pts ❌
- Correct: 16 × 3 = 48 pts ✅

### Root Cause

`/api/team/[teamId]/gameweek/[gw]/route.ts` (line 189) was calling `calculateProvisionalBonus()` without checking if the gameweek was completed. For completed GWs, `player.points` from `scoreCalculator` already contains official bonus baked into `total_points`.

### Solution

Added status check before calculating provisional bonus:
```typescript
const provisionalBonus = status === 'completed' ? 0 : calculateProvisionalBonus(player.id, fixturesData);
```

### Files Modified
- `src/app/api/team/[teamId]/gameweek/[gw]/route.ts` - Added GW status guard (line 191)

### Impact
- ✅ Completed GW scores now match FPL official totals
- ✅ Captain multipliers apply to correct base (Haaland TC: 48 not 57)
- ✅ Live GWs still show provisional bonus correctly
- ✅ No impact on other score calculations (`liveMatch.ts` already had this check)

### Testing
- Verified: GW17 completed, Haaland with 3 bonus
  - TC (×3): Shows 48 pts ✅ (was 57 ❌)
  - C (×2): Shows 32 pts ✅ (was 38 ❌)
