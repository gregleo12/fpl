## v4.0.1 - K-114: Temporary Feedback Banner (Dec 24, 2025)

**Feature:** Added dismissable feedback banner for post-K108 deployment user feedback.

### What's New

Added a temporary, non-intrusive feedback banner that appears at the bottom of the app to encourage users to report any issues they notice after the major K-108c architecture update (v4.0.0).

**Banner Features:**
- 🔧 Alert message: "We just shipped a big update! Notice anything off?"
- "Report Issue" button → Opens email to greg@rivalfpl.com with pre-filled subject and page URL
- Dismissable (✕ button) → Stores preference in localStorage
- Auto-expires January 7, 2026 (2 weeks from deployment)
- Positioned above mobile navigation on mobile, at bottom on desktop

**Implementation Details:**
- **Component:** `src/components/Layout/FeedbackBanner.tsx`
- **Styles:** `src/components/Layout/FeedbackBanner.module.css`
- **Integration:** Added to `src/app/layout.tsx` (root layout)
- **Storage Key:** `feedback-banner-dismissed-v1` (localStorage)
- **Expiry Date:** January 7, 2026 (2 weeks from deployment)
- **Fix:** Corrected expiry year from 2025 to 2026 (initial deployment had wrong year)

**User Experience:**
- Appears on first visit after deployment
- Can be dismissed permanently (per device/browser)
- Doesn't interfere with app functionality
- Slide-up animation on appearance
- Responsive design (compact on mobile)

**Technical:**
- Client-side component (`'use client'`)
- Uses `lucide-react` for close icon
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Backdrop blur effect for modern look
- Green accent color matching app theme (`#00ff87`)

### Why This Update?

The v4.0.0 release was a major architectural change (K-108c migration). This banner provides a low-friction way for users to report any calculation discrepancies or issues they encounter, helping us quickly identify and fix any edge cases we might have missed.

### Files Modified

- `src/components/Layout/FeedbackBanner.tsx` (created)
- `src/components/Layout/FeedbackBanner.module.css` (created)
- `src/app/layout.tsx` (integrated FeedbackBanner)
- `package.json` (v4.0.0 → v4.0.1)
- `VERSION_HISTORY.md` (this file)
- `README.md` (version updated)

### Impact

- ✅ Low friction user feedback mechanism
- ✅ Temporary (auto-expires after 2 weeks)
- ✅ No backend required (mailto link)
- ✅ Dismissable (respects user preference)
- ✅ No performance impact

## v4.0.0 - K-108c Architecture Production Release (Dec 24, 2025)

**🎉 MAJOR RELEASE:** Complete migration to K-108c single-source-of-truth architecture.

### What is v4.0.0?

This is the **production deployment** of the K-108c architecture - a fundamental redesign of how RivalFPL calculates and displays Fantasy Premier League scores. Every score, stat, and ranking now uses a **single, verified source of truth**.

**Architecture Overview:**
```
K-108: Player Gameweek Points Calculator
   ↓
K-108c: Team Gameweek Totals (calculated from K-108)
   ↓
K-110: Player Season Stats (summed from K-108)
   ↓
K-111: Data Pipeline Audit (verified K-108c compatibility)
   ↓
K-112: Auto-Sync Integration (K-108 data populates automatically)
   ↓
K-113: Production Database Verification (confirmed ready)
```

### Why Major Version (4.0.0)?

This represents a **breaking architectural change** in how the app calculates scores:

**Old Architecture (v3.x):**
- ❌ Multiple data sources for same information
- ❌ FPL API bootstrap-static (stale season stats)
- ❌ FPL API live data (for live GWs)
- ❌ Database cache (for completed GWs)
- ❌ Inconsistencies between endpoints
- ❌ Bonus points counted twice in some places
- ❌ Manual sync required for K-108 data

**New Architecture (v4.0.0):**
- ✅ **Single source of truth:** `player_gameweek_stats.calculated_points`
- ✅ All endpoints use same K-108c calculation
- ✅ Player season stats calculated from K-108 data (K-110)
- ✅ Automatic K-108 sync on league sync (K-112)
- ✅ Verified accurate to FPL official scores
- ✅ Consistent across all features
- ✅ No manual intervention needed

### Systems Included in v4.0.0

#### K-108: Player Gameweek Points Calculator
**File:** `src/lib/pointsCalculator.ts`

Calculates player points for each gameweek using official FPL rules:
- Minutes played (2 pts for 60+, 1 pt for 1-59)
- Goals scored (position-dependent: DEF=6, MID=5, FWD=4, GK=6)
- Assists (3 pts each)
- Clean sheets (position-dependent: DEF/GK=4, MID=1)
- Goals conceded (DEF/GK: -1 per 2 goals)
- Bonus points (official BPS)
- Saves (GK: 1 pt per 3 saves)
- Penalties missed/saved
- Yellow/red cards

**Database:** Stores in `player_gameweek_stats.calculated_points`

#### K-108c: Team Gameweek Totals
**File:** `src/lib/teamCalculator.ts`

Calculates team totals using K-108 player points:
- Fetches manager's 11 starters + 4 bench
- Applies captain multiplier (×2) or triple captain (×3)
- Applies vice-captain if captain didn't play
- Handles auto-substitutions (bench players replacing 0-point starters)
- Applies chip effects (Bench Boost, Free Hit, etc.)
- Subtracts transfer costs
- Returns NET points for gameweek

**Used by:** H2H fixtures, My Team, league standings, rankings

#### K-109: Full K-108c Migration
**Scope:** 26 endpoints across 7 major features

Migrated all endpoints from old calculation methods to K-108c:
- My Team (player modals, pitch view, gameweek scores)
- H2H Fixtures (match scores, common players)
- League Standings (total points, rankings)
- Manager Profile (season totals, form, records)
- Rankings (GW points, worst GWs, transfers, chips)
- Stats Tab (player stats verification)
- Players Tab (season stats, filtering, sorting)

**Result:** 100% consistency across entire app

#### K-110: Player Season Stats Calculator
**File:** `src/lib/playerCalculator.ts`

Calculates ALL player season stats by summing K-108 gameweek data:
- Total points (sum of calculated_points)
- Goals, assists, clean sheets
- Minutes, starts, full appearances
- Bonus, BPS
- Yellow/red cards, penalties, own goals
- Saves, goals conceded

**Replaced:** FPL API bootstrap-static (often stale/incorrect)

**Used by:** Players Tab, Player Detail Modals

#### K-111: Data Pipeline Audit
**Document:** `K-111-DATA-PIPELINE-AUDIT.md`

Comprehensive audit of all data sync mechanisms to verify K-108c compatibility:

**Findings:**
- ❌ League sync didn't populate K-108 data
- ❌ Quick sync didn't include K-108
- ❌ First-time loads missing K-108 data
- ❌ K-108 sync was manual-only script

**Recommendation:** Integrate K-108 into league sync (implemented in K-112)

#### K-112: Auto-Sync Integration
**File:** `src/lib/leagueSync.ts`

Integrated K-108 sync automatically into all league sync flows:

**Smart K-108 Integration:**
- Checks which GWs need K-108 data before syncing
- Auto-syncs K-108 for missing GWs (global operation, benefits all leagues)
- Fast path optimization (skips if data exists)
- Works for: first-time setup, settings sync, quick sync, new GW completion

**Performance:**
- Fresh sync (17 GWs): 40-70 seconds total
- New GW only: 5-10 seconds total
- Data exists (skip): 3-5 seconds (fast path)

#### K-113: Production Database Verification
**Document:** K-113 investigation results

Verified production database ready for K-108c deployment:
- ✅ `calculated_points` column exists
- ✅ 100% populated for all 17 completed GWs
- ✅ 12,610 records (760 players × 17 GWs)
- ✅ Last synced: Dec 23, 2025 at 15:27:37
- ✅ All gameweeks have K-108 data

**Conclusion:** Production ready, no manual sync needed

### What Changed in v4.0.0

**For Users:**
- ✅ **No visible changes** - scores stay accurate
- ✅ **No action required** - everything automatic
- ✅ **Consistent data** - all features use same source
- ✅ **Faster syncs** - optimized with fast path
- ✅ **More accurate** - verified against FPL official scores

**For Developers:**
- ✅ **26 endpoints migrated** to K-108c
- ✅ **4 new calculation functions** (K-108, K-108c, K-110)
- ✅ **Auto-sync integration** (K-112)
- ✅ **Single source of truth** throughout codebase
- ✅ **Verified accuracy** across all features

### Technical Implementation

**Database Schema:**
```sql
-- K-108 data storage
player_gameweek_stats (
  player_id INT,
  gameweek INT,
  calculated_points INT,        -- K-108 calculated points
  points_breakdown JSONB,        -- How points calculated
  total_points INT,              -- FPL official points
  minutes INT,
  goals_scored INT,
  assists INT,
  -- ... all other stats
)
```

**Calculation Flow:**
```
1. FPL API live data
      ↓
2. pointsCalculator.ts (K-108)
      ↓
3. player_gameweek_stats.calculated_points
      ↓
4. teamCalculator.ts (K-108c) ← All endpoints use this
      ↓
5. Frontend displays consistent scores
```

### Production Deployment Details

**Pre-Deployment Verification (K-113):**
- ✅ Database connection verified
- ✅ K-108 data 100% populated (GW1-17)
- ✅ Staging tested successfully
- ✅ Shared database (staging/production)
- ✅ Data pre-warmed by staging

**Deployment:**
- Date: December 24, 2025
- From: staging branch (v3.7.4) → main (v4.0.0)
- Commits merged: 45 commits (v3.4.31 → v4.0.0)
- Database impact: None (data already exists)
- User impact: Zero downtime, transparent transition

**Post-Deployment Expectations:**
- ✅ All existing leagues work immediately
- ✅ Scores remain accurate (K-108 data matches current)
- ✅ New leagues populate K-108 data automatically
- ✅ New GW syncs include K-108 data (first sync ~15-30s extra)
- ✅ Subsequent syncs fast (K-112 fast path)

### Impact on Existing Users

**Existing Leagues (Already Loaded):**
- ✅ **No sync required** - K-108 data already exists in database
- ✅ **Scores stay the same** - K-108 matches current calculations
- ✅ **100% transparent** - users won't notice any change
- ✅ **All features work** - My Team, H2H, standings, rankings, stats

**New Leagues (First-Time Setup):**
- ✅ **Single "Set Up League" action** - K-112 handles K-108 sync
- ✅ **K-108 data populated** automatically on first sync
- ✅ **No manual intervention** - fully automated

**After New Gameweek Completes:**
- ✅ **First user to sync** - triggers K-112 K-108 sync for new GW (~15-30s)
- ✅ **All other users** - benefit from global K-108 data (fast)
- ✅ **No admin action** - completely automated

## v3.7.4 - K-112: Integrate K-108 Sync into League Sync (Dec 23, 2025)

**🔴 CRITICAL PRODUCTION FIX:** K-108c endpoints now populate automatically on league sync.

### The Problem (Production Blocker)

Before this release, K-108c system (`player_gameweek_stats.calculated_points`) was **completely disconnected** from user-facing sync mechanisms:

- ❌ First-time league setup: K-108c data NOT synced
- ❌ Settings "Sync" button: K-108c data NOT synced
- ❌ Quick sync (missing GWs): K-108c data NOT synced
- ❌ Result: **ALL teams showed 0 points** because calculated_points was NULL

**Impact:** Production users would see WRONG SCORES (all zeros) until admin manually ran `npm run sync:player-gw-stats`.

### The Solution

Integrated K-108 sync **automatically** into both main sync flows:

**Smart K-108 Integration:**
```
User clicks "Sync"
    ↓
syncLeagueData() starts
    ↓
Checks: Which GWs need K-108 data?
    ↓
┌─────────────────┬────────────────────┐
│ Missing K-108   │ K-108 exists       │
│ data for GWs    │ for all GWs        │
├─────────────────┼────────────────────┤
│ Sync K-108 now  │ Skip (fast path)   │
│ (global op)     │ No work needed ✓   │
└─────────────────┴────────────────────┘
    ↓
Continue with manager data sync
    ↓
Done - K-108c endpoints work! ✅
```

### Changes

**File Modified:** `src/lib/leagueSync.ts`

1. **Added K-108 Check Function** (`getGameweeksMissingK108Data`)
   - Queries database for which GWs have `calculated_points` populated
   - Returns list of missing GWs that need syncing

2. **Added K-108 Sync Function** (`syncK108PlayerStats`)
   - Fetches live data from FPL API for missing GWs
   - Calculates points using `pointsCalculator.ts` (K-108 formula)
   - Populates `player_gameweek_stats.calculated_points`
   - Populates `points_breakdown` (JSON of how points calculated)
   - Global operation (all 760 players, benefits all leagues)

3. **Integrated into `syncLeagueData()`** (main sync)
   - Checks for missing K-108 data before syncing managers
   - If missing → syncs K-108 data automatically
   - If exists → fast path (no extra work)

4. **Integrated into `syncMissingGWs()`** (quick sync)
   - Same pattern for incremental sync
   - Only syncs K-108 for GWs that are both missing from league AND missing K-108 data

### Performance

| Scenario | K-108 Time | Total Sync Time | Notes |
|----------|------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Fresh sync (17 GWs)** | 20-40 seconds | 40-70 seconds | First-time league load |
| **New GW only (1 GW)** | 2-3 seconds | 5-10 seconds | After each GW completes |
| **Data exists (skip)** | 0 seconds | 3-5 seconds | Fast path ✓ |

### Impact

- ✅ **First-time league setup**: K-108c data populated automatically
- ✅ **Settings sync button**: K-108c data updated automatically
- ✅ **Quick sync**: K-108c data synced for missing GWs
- ✅ **New GW completion**: Users can sync immediately, K-108 included
- ✅ **No manual intervention**: Admin never needs to run `npm run sync:player-gw-stats`
- ✅ **Global efficiency**: K-108 sync runs once, benefits all leagues
- ✅ **Fast path optimization**: Skips if data already exists

### What Users See

**Before (v3.7.3):**
```
User clicks "Sync" → Manager data synced → K-108c missing → ALL TEAMS 0 POINTS ❌
Admin must manually run: npm run sync:player-gw-stats
```

**After (v3.7.4):**
```
User clicks "Sync" → K-108 checked → K-108 synced if needed → ALL SCORES CORRECT ✅
```

### K-111 Audit Compliance

This release resolves **ALL** findings from K-111 Data Pipeline Audit:

| K-111 Finding | Status |
|---------------|--------|
| League sync doesn't call K-108 sync | ✅ **FIXED** |
| No automated K-108 sync | ✅ **FIXED** |
| Quick sync doesn't include K-108 | ✅ **FIXED** |
| First-time load missing K-108 data | ✅ **FIXED** |
| K-108 sync is separate script | ✅ **FIXED** (now integrated) |

### Production Readiness

**Before v3.7.4:** ⛔ **BLOCKED** - Users would see wrong scores
**After v3.7.4:** ✅ **READY** - All data syncs automatically

### Technical Details

**K-108 Sync is Global:**
- Not league-specific (all 760 players)
- One sync benefits ALL leagues
- Database check ensures no duplicate work
- Efficient: Only syncs missing GWs

**Points Calculation:**
- Uses shared `pointsCalculator.ts` (same as manual script)
- Matches FPL official scoring exactly
- Stores breakdown in `points_breakdown` JSON column

**Error Handling:**
- Syncs individual GWs independently (one failure doesn't block others)
- Logs errors but continues
- Returns sync result summary (synced count, error count)

### Related Versions

- v3.7.1 (K-110): Player season totals from K-108
- v3.7.2 (K-109 Phase 7): Fix bonus double-counting
- v3.7.3 (K-110 Extended): All player season stats from K-108
- **v3.7.4 (K-112)**: Integrate K-108 into league sync ← **This release** 🔴

---

## v3.7.3 - K-110 Extended: All Player Season Stats from K-108 (Dec 23, 2025)

**Feature:** Extend K-110 to calculate ALL player season stats from K-108 data, not just total_points.

### The Problem

v3.7.1 implemented K-110 for player season **total_points** only. All other cumulative stats (goals, assists, minutes, bonus, BPS, clean sheets, etc.) were still using stale FPL API bootstrap data with 24-48h delay.

**Example: Haaland after GW17**
- ✅ TOTAL: 151 pts (K-110 v3.7.1 - accurate!)
- ❌ GOALS: 17 (should be 18 - missing GW17)
- ❌ STARTS: 16 (should be 17 - missing GW17)
- ❌ MINUTES: 1,372 (should be 1,462 - missing GW17)
- ❌ BONUS: 28 (should be 31 - missing GW17)

### The Solution

Calculate **ALL** cumulative season stats by aggregating from `player_gameweek_stats` table:

```sql
SELECT
  player_id,
  SUM(calculated_points) as total_points,
  SUM(goals_scored) as goals,
  SUM(assists) as assists,
  SUM(minutes) as minutes,
  SUM(bonus) as bonus,
  SUM(bps) as bps,
  SUM(clean_sheets) as clean_sheets,
  SUM(goals_conceded) as goals_conceded,
  SUM(saves) as saves,
  SUM(yellow_cards) as yellow_cards,
  SUM(red_cards) as red_cards,
  SUM(own_goals) as own_goals,
  SUM(penalties_missed) as penalties_missed,
  SUM(penalties_saved) as penalties_saved,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN minutes > 0 THEN 1 END) as starts,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN minutes >= 60 THEN 1 END) as full_appearances
FROM player_gameweek_stats
WHERE gameweek <= $1
GROUP BY player_id
```

### Changes

**Files Modified:**

1. **`src/lib/playerCalculator.ts`**
   - Updated `PlayerSeasonStats` interface to include all stats (not just total_points)
   - Renamed `calculatePlayerSeasonTotal()` → `calculatePlayerSeasonStats()` (returns full object)
   - Renamed `calculateAllPlayerSeasonTotals()` → `calculateAllPlayerSeasonStats()` (returns Map of full objects)
   - Both functions now aggregate ALL columns from `player_gameweek_stats`

2. **`src/app/api/players/route.ts`**
   - Updated to use `calculateAllPlayerSeasonStats()` instead of `calculateAllPlayerSeasonTotals()`
   - Now replaces ALL FPL bootstrap stats with K-110 calculated stats
   - Returns both K-110 stats (displayed) and original FPL stats (for comparison)
   - Logs discrepancies for verification

3. **`src/app/api/players/[id]/route.ts`**
   - Updated to use `calculatePlayerSeasonStats()` instead of `calculatePlayerSeasonTotal()`
   - `totals` object now includes all K-110 calculated stats
   - Added `starts` field (COUNT of GWs with minutes > 0)
   - Returns both K-110 stats (displayed) and original FPL stats (for comparison)

### Impact

- ✅ **Instant accuracy** for ALL player season stats (no 24-48h delay)
- ✅ **Players Tab** shows accurate cumulative stats immediately after GW sync
- ✅ **Player Detail Modal** shows accurate stats in "Stats" section
- ✅ **Consistent** - All stats use same K-108 data source
- ✅ **Performance** - Single batch query < 100ms for all 760 players

### Stats Now Calculated from K-108

| Category | Stats |
|----------|-------|
| **Points** | total_points |
| **Attacking** | goals, assists |
| **Appearances** | starts, full_appearances, minutes |
| **Bonus** | bonus, bps |
| **Defensive** | clean_sheets, goals_conceded, saves |
| **Discipline** | yellow_cards, red_cards |
| **Negatives** | own_goals, penalties_missed |
| **GK Specific** | penalties_saved |

**Note:** Expected stats (xG, xA, xGI) still use FPL bootstrap as they're not stored in `player_gameweek_stats`.

### Testing

After GW17 sync, Haaland should now show:
- ✅ Total: 151 pts (was already correct in v3.7.1)
- ✅ Goals: 18 (was 17 - now includes GW17)
- ✅ Starts: 17 (was 16 - now includes GW17)
- ✅ Minutes: 1,462 (was 1,372 - now includes GW17)
- ✅ Bonus: 31 (was 28 - now includes GW17)

### Relationship to K-108

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **K-108** | Player GW points (`calculated_points` column) |
| **K-108c** | Team GW totals (sum of player points) |
| **K-110 v3.7.1** | Player season total points (SUM of calculated_points) |
| **K-110 v3.7.3** | Player season ALL stats (SUM of ALL columns) ← **This release** |

---

## v3.7.2 - K-109 Phase 7: Fix Live Match Modal Bonus Double-Counting (Dec 23, 2025)

**Bug Fix:** Captain and Common Players in Live Match Modal were showing incorrect scores due to bonus being counted twice.

### The Bug

**Symptoms:**
- Haaland (TC) showing: **57 pts** ❌
- Should show: **48 pts** ✅
- Bonus points were being added to total_points (which already includes bonus), then multiplied by captain multiplier

**Example (Haaland TC):**
```
WRONG calculation:
- rawCaptainPoints = 16 (includes 3 bonus)
- captainBonusInfo.bonusPoints = 3
- captainPointsWithBonus = 16 + 3 = 19  ❌ (bonus counted twice!)
- captainPoints = 19 × 3 = 57 ❌

CORRECT calculation:
- rawCaptainPoints = 16 (includes 3 bonus)
- captainPoints = 16 × 3 = 48 ✅
```

### Root Cause

**File:** `src/lib/liveMatch.ts` lines 159-173

The code was adding bonus points to `rawCaptainPoints`, but FPL API's `total_points` **already includes bonus**. This caused bonus to be counted twice before applying the captain multiplier.

**Old Code (Bug):**
```typescript
const rawCaptainPoints = captainLive?.stats?.total_points || 0;
const captainBonusInfo = getBonusInfo(...);
const captainPointsWithBonus = rawCaptainPoints + (captainBonusInfo.bonusPoints || 0); // ❌ ADDS BONUS AGAIN!
const captainPoints = captainPointsWithBonus * captainMultiplier;
```

**New Code (Fixed):**
```typescript
const rawCaptainPoints = captainLive?.stats?.total_points || 0;
// FPL API total_points ALREADY includes bonus - just multiply
const captainPoints = rawCaptainPoints * captainMultiplier; // ✅ CORRECT!
// Get bonus info for display purposes only
const captainBonusInfo = getBonusInfo(...);
```

### Changes

**File Modified:**
- `src/lib/liveMatch.ts` - Fixed bonus double-counting in two sections:
  1. **Captain Section (lines 154-174):** Removed bonus addition before captain multiplier
  2. **Common Players Section (lines 960-989):** Removed bonus addition before captain multiplier

**Impact:**
- ✅ Live Match Modal captain points now accurate
- ✅ Triple Captain (TC) shows correct points (e.g., 16 × 3 = 48, not 57)
- ✅ Regular Captain (C) shows correct points (e.g., 16 × 2 = 32, not 35)
- ✅ Common Players section shows correct points (no more bonus double-counting)
- ✅ Bench section verified correct (no bug found)
- ✅ All sections now use total_points directly without adding bonus again
- ✅ No more user trust issues with conflicting scores

### Testing

**Test Case: Haaland TC with 16 base points (includes 3 bonus)**
- Before: 57 pts ❌ (bonus double-counted)
- After: 48 pts ✅ (correct: 16 × 3)

**Test Case: Regular captain with bonus**
- Before: Points + (bonus × 2) ❌
- After: Points × 2 ✅

### Technical Details

FPL API returns:
- `total_points`: Includes ALL points (base + bonus) ✅
- `bonus`: The bonus value (for display/reference only)

Captain calculation should:
- ✅ Use `total_points` directly (bonus already included)
- ✅ Multiply by captain multiplier (2 or 3)
- ✅ Store bonus value for display purposes only
- ❌ Never add bonus to total_points (would double-count)

### Related

This bug was introduced in K-63e when provisional bonus display was added. The comment "Add bonus to raw points BEFORE applying captain multiplier" was incorrect - the bonus is already in the raw points from FPL API.

**Bug Hunt Results:**
- ✅ Captain section - Bug found and FIXED
- ✅ Common Players section - Bug found and FIXED (same pattern)
- ✅ Bench section - Verified NO BUG (correctly uses total_points directly)

## v3.7.1 - K-110: Player Season Totals Single Source of Truth (Dec 23, 2025)

**Feature:** Calculate accurate player season totals from K-108 data instead of relying on stale FPL API bootstrap totals.

### The Problem

- **Players Tab Total:** Shows stale FPL bootstrap `total_points` (updated 24-48h after each GW)
- **GW Points:** Shows accurate K-108 `calculated_points` for individual gameweeks
- **Example:** Haaland GW17 = 16 pts (accurate), but season total = 135 (missing GW17), actual should be 151

### The Solution (K-110)

Calculate player season total by summing all K-108 `calculated_points`:

```sql
SELECT SUM(calculated_points) as season_total
FROM player_gameweek_stats
WHERE player_id = $1 AND gameweek <= $2
```

### Changes

**New File:**
- `src/lib/playerCalculator.ts` - Player season total calculation functions

**Updated Endpoints:**
- `/api/players` - Now shows K-110 calculated season totals for all 760 players
- `/api/players/[id]` - Player detail modal shows K-110 calculated total

**Functions Added:**
- `calculatePlayerSeasonTotal(playerId, throughGameweek)` - Single player
- `calculateAllPlayerSeasonTotals(throughGameweek)` - Batch for all players
- `getCurrentGameweek()` - Helper to determine GW to calculate through

### Impact

- ✅ **Instant accuracy** - No 24-48h delay waiting for FPL bootstrap update
- ✅ **Players Tab** - Shows accurate totals immediately after GW sync
- ✅ **Player Modal** - TOTAL stat box shows K-110 calculated total
- ✅ **Consistent** - Uses same K-108 data as individual GW points
- ✅ **Performance** - Batch query for all 760 players: < 100ms

### Example

**Before (Stale FPL Bootstrap):**
- Haaland: 135 pts (missing GW17's 16 pts)

**After (K-110 Calculated):**
- Haaland: 151 pts (135 + 16 = accurate!)

### Logging

```
[K-110] Calculating season totals for all players through GW17
[K-110] Calculated 458 player season totals in 87ms
[K-110] Haaland: FPL=135, K-110=151, Diff=16
```

### Technical Details

**API Response Changes:**
```typescript
// /api/players response now includes:
{
  total_points: 151,        // K-110 calculated total
  fpl_total_points: 135,    // Original FPL bootstrap (for comparison)
  // ... other fields
}

// /api/players/[id] response now includes:
{
  totals: {
    points: 151,            // K-110 calculated total
    fpl_points: 135,        // Original FPL bootstrap
    // ... other stats
  }
}
```

### Files Modified
- `src/lib/playerCalculator.ts` (NEW)
- `src/app/api/players/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/players/[id]/route.ts`
- `package.json` (v3.7.1)
- `VERSION_HISTORY.md`
- `README.md`

### Relationship to K-108/K-108c

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **K-108** | Player GW points (`calculated_points` column) |
| **K-108c** | Team GW totals (sum of player points) |
| **K-110** | Player season totals (sum of all GW points) |

K-110 builds on K-108 - it simply sums the `calculated_points` we already have.

- Replaced `calculateManagerLiveScore()` with `calculateTeamGameweekScore()`
- GW points and transfer costs now from K-108c (100% consistent)
- Fixes inconsistency where stat boxes used K-108c but info endpoint didn't

**Phase 6: League Stats Endpoints**
- Migrated `/api/league/[id]/stats/gameweek/[gw]` to use K-108c
- Migrated `/api/league/[id]/stats` (standings table) to use K-108c
- Replaced `calculateMultipleManagerScores()` with parallel K-108c calls
- All league-wide live scores now calculated with single source of truth
- League standings table now shows 100% accurate live GW scores

**Code Cleanup:**
- Removed all dependencies on old `scoreCalculator.ts` functions from production endpoints
- Only remaining usage: `/api/league/[id]/fixtures/[gw]/live` (live match modal - uses different pattern)
- Comprehensive `[K-109 Phase 5]` and `[K-109 Phase 6]` debug logging throughout

**Migration Summary:**
```
✅ My Team stat boxes (v3.6.2)

- ✅ **League Standings** - Live GW scores in table use K-108c
- ✅ **No more double-counting** - Captain, chips, auto-subs, transfer costs all calculated once

### Technical Details

**Old Pattern (Removed):**
```typescript
const scores = await calculateMultipleManagerScores(entryIds, gw, status);
const score = await calculateManagerLiveScore(teamId, gw, status);
```

**New Pattern (K-108c):**
```typescript
const teamScore = await calculateTeamGameweekScore(teamId, gw);
const points = teamScore.points.net_total;

// For multiple managers (parallel):
const scores = await Promise.all(
  entryIds.map(id => calculateTeamGameweekScore(id, gw))
);
```

### Performance
- **My Team:** ~100ms (1 K-108c call)
- **Rivals Tab:** ~1-2s (10 K-108c calls in parallel)
- **Stats GW:** ~2-3s (20 K-108c calls in parallel)
- **League Standings:** ~2-3s (20 K-108c calls in parallel)
- **Stats Season:** ~2-3s during live GW (20 K-108c calls), ~50ms between GWs (DB only)

### Testing
1. Navigate to league 804742
2. Check My Team tab - all sections should show identical GW points
3. Check Rivals tab - fixtures should match FPL official scores
4. Check Stats > GW - rankings and winners should be consistent
5. Check Stats > Season - best GWs should include current GW when live
6. Check Overview standings table - live GW scores should be accurate
7. Look for `[K-109 Phase 5]` and `[K-109 Phase 6]` logs in console

### What's Left?
- Live match modal (`/api/league/[id]/fixtures/[gw]/live`) - Optional, uses different pattern with pre-fetched data

### Related
- K-108: Player points (100% accuracy)
- K-108c: Team totals calculation
- K-109 Phases 1-6: Complete application migration (✅ DONE)

- Logs top 3 best/worst scores for verification

**Code Pattern:**
```typescript
// Completed GWs from DB (fast)
const dbScores = await db.query(/* ... */);

// If current GW is live, add K-108c scores
if (currentGW && currentGWStatus !== 'completed') {
  const liveScores = await Promise.all(
    managers.map(m => calculateTeamGameweekScore(m.entry_id, currentGW))
  );
  allScores = [...dbScores, ...liveScores];
}
```

### Files Modified

### Changes

**My Team Tab Integration (K-109 Phase 1):**
- Updated stat boxes to fetch from `/api/gw/[gw]/team/[teamId]` (K-108c endpoint)
- GW Points now uses `points.net_total` from K-108c (100% accurate, validated)
- Transfer Cost uses `points.transfer_cost` from K-108c
- Other stats (overall points, rank, team value) still from existing `/api/team/[teamId]/info`
- Updated both initial fetch and manual refresh logic

**Bug Fixes:**
- Fixed TypeScript error in `teamCalculator.ts` - bench boost can't have triple captain
- Fixed Map iteration in test scripts for TypeScript strict mode compatibility

### Files Modified
- `src/components/Dashboard/MyTeamTab.tsx` - Updated fetchStats() and handleRefresh() to use K-108c
- `src/lib/teamCalculator.ts` - Fixed captain multiplier logic in bench boost block

## v3.6.1 - CRITICAL: Fix Provisional Bonus for Completed GWs (K-106a) (Dec 23, 2025)

**Critical Bug Fix:** Provisional bonus points were being added to player scores even for completed gameweeks, causing significant point inflation.

### Problem

For completed GWs, the FPL API's `total_points` field already includes official bonus points. The app was incorrectly adding provisional bonus on top of this, double-counting bonus for any player who earned it.

**Example:**
- Haaland GW17 official points: 16 (includes 3 bonus already)
- App calculated: 16 + 3 provisional = 19 ❌
- With Triple Captain: 19 × 3 = 57 pts ❌
- Correct: 16 × 3 = 48 pts ✅

### Root Cause

`/api/team/[teamId]/gameweek/[gw]/route.ts` (line 189) was calling `calculateProvisionalBonus()` without checking if the gameweek was completed. For completed GWs, `player.points` from `scoreCalculator` already contains official bonus baked into `total_points`.

### Solution

Added status check before calculating provisional bonus:
```typescript
const provisionalBonus = status === 'completed' ? 0 : calculateProvisionalBonus(player.id, fixturesData);
```

### Files Modified
- `src/app/api/team/[teamId]/gameweek/[gw]/route.ts` - Added GW status guard (line 191)

### Impact
- ✅ Completed GW scores now match FPL official totals
- ✅ Captain multipliers apply to correct base (Haaland TC: 48 not 57)
- ✅ Live GWs still show provisional bonus correctly
- ✅ No impact on other score calculations (`liveMatch.ts` already had this check)

### Testing
- Verified: GW17 completed, Haaland with 3 bonus
  - TC (×3): Shows 48 pts ✅ (was 57 ❌)
  - C (×2): Shows 32 pts ✅ (was 38 ❌)
