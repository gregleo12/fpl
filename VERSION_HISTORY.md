## v3.0.3 - My Team DB Optimization (Dec 18, 2025)

**PATCH RELEASE:** Optimize My Team to use database for completed gameweeks.

### Performance Improvements
- **Database-First for Completed GWs:** My Team now uses database instead of FPL API for completed gameweeks
  - Player stats fetched from `player_gameweek_stats` table
  - Fixtures fetched from `pl_fixtures` table
  - Reduces external API calls from 3-4 per view to 1 (bootstrap only)
  - Target load time: < 200ms (down from 500ms+)
- **Graceful Fallback:** Automatically falls back to API if database data is missing
- **Live GW Unchanged:** Current/in-progress gameweeks still use API for real-time data

### Technical Changes
- Added `fetchPlayerStatsFromDB()` function in `/src/lib/scoreCalculator.ts`
- Added `fetchFixturesFromDB()` function in `/src/lib/scoreCalculator.ts`
- Updated `fetchScoreData()` to check GW status and use DB for completed GWs
- Data transformation matches FPL API format (no frontend changes needed)
- Console logging for debugging DB vs API usage

### Impact
- Completed GWs load ~60-70% faster
- Reduced load on FPL API
- Better user experience for historical data viewing
- No visual changes for users

## v3.0.2 - Sync Pipeline Enhancement (Dec 18, 2025)

**PATCH RELEASE:** Add manager_picks and pl_fixtures to automatic sync pipeline.

### New Features
- **Manager Picks Syncing:** Full squad selections (15 players) now synced automatically per GW
  - Includes starting 11 + 4 bench players
  - Synced in both full sync and incremental sync
  - Enables My Team to use database for completed GWs instead of API calls
- **PL Fixtures Syncing:** Premier League fixtures now synced automatically
  - Only completed fixtures synced (finished = true)
  - League-independent (synced once per sync run)
  - Enables fixture-based features to use database

### Technical
- Added `syncPLFixtures()` function in `/src/lib/leagueSync.ts`
- Added manager_picks sync to `syncManagerData()` function
- Added manager_picks sync to `syncMissingGWs()` function
- Added manager_picks to force clear cleanup section
- Both tables use ON CONFLICT upsert pattern for idempotency

### Performance Impact
- Reduces API calls for My Team when viewing completed GWs
- Enables offline/cached access to historical squad data

## v3.0.1 - Empty State Fix (Dec 18, 2025)

**PATCH RELEASE:** UX improvement for GW Transfers display.

### Bug Fixes
- Added "No transfers made" empty state message for GW Transfers
- GW Transfers container now displays for all GWs (previously hidden when empty)
- Improved styling for empty state (centered, italic, subtle color)

### Investigation Results
- Verified transfers data is working correctly (39,960 transfers synced across all leagues)
- Confirmed 0 transfers is legitimate data (5-50% of managers make no transfers per GW)
- Root cause: Empty state appeared broken, needed UX improvement

## v3.0.0 - Sync Infrastructure Release (Dec 18, 2025)

**MAJOR RELEASE:** Complete data sync infrastructure for all leagues.

### New Features
- **Auto-sync on first load (K-32a):** New leagues automatically sync all historical data with progress bar
- **Incremental sync (K-32b):** Returning users get missing completed GWs synced automatically
- **Quick Sync button (K-32d):** Fast sync of missing GWs only (1-5 seconds)
- **Full Re-sync button (K-32c):** Complete re-sync of all historical data
- **Transfers in sync pipeline:** GW Transfers now synced automatically for all leagues

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed GW Transfers SQL column error (pin.team → pin.team_id)
- Fixed incremental sync SQL placeholder bug ($13)
- Fixed player modal tabs data fetching

### Technical
- New sync functions in `/src/lib/leagueSync.ts`
- Sync status tracking in `leagues` table
- Progress bar component for first-time sync
- Manager transfers included in all sync operations
