- **Logo Design:**
  - Text-based logo using CSS/HTML: "Rival/FPL"
  - Three components: "Rival" + "/" + "FPL"
  - Color scheme:
    - "Rival": White (#ffffff) - matches text on dark background
    - "/": FPL green (#00ff87) - official FPL brand color
    - "FPL": FPL green (#00ff87) - official FPL brand color
  - Diagonal slash connects "Rival" to "FPL"

### v2.4.44 - Fix Breakpoint Mismatch (Align to 769px) (Dec 12, 2025)
**BUG FIX:** Fixed layout inconsistency caused by mismatched media query breakpoints
- **Problem:** Between 769px and 1023px screen width, nav bar was full-width but My Team content was narrow
  - Nav bar desktop layout triggered at `@media (min-width: 769px)` ✅
  - My Team content desktop layout triggered at `@media (min-width: 1024px)` ❌
  - 255px "dead zone" where layouts were inconsistent
  - Visual mismatch: full-width nav bar with narrow content
- **Root Cause Analysis:**
  - Nav bar (.tabs) used 769px breakpoint - matching content padding breakpoint
  - My Team content (.myTeamContent) used 1024px breakpoint - inconsistent
  - Mobile styles (.section) applied up to 1024px, overlapping with desktop
  - Investigation identified all breakpoints across CSS files
- **Solution:** Align all desktop transitions to 769px breakpoint
- **Changes:**
  - **1. My Team Content Breakpoint:**
    - Changed `.myTeamContent` from `@media (min-width: 1024px)` to `@media (min-width: 769px)`
    - Location: Dashboard.module.css:892
    - Now matches nav bar and content padding breakpoints
  - **2. Mobile Section Breakpoint:**
    - Changed `.section` from `@media (max-width: 1024px)` to `@media (max-width: 768px)`
    - Location: Dashboard.module.css:567
    - Eliminates breakpoint overlap
    - Mobile styles now end at 768px, desktop starts at 769px
- **Result:** Consistent layout at all screen widths
  - ✓ Nav bar desktop layout: 769px+ (unchanged)
  - ✓ Content padding desktop: 769px+ (unchanged)
  - ✓ My Team content desktop: 769px+ (changed from 1024px)
  - ✓ Mobile styles: ≤768px (changed from ≤1024px)
  - ✓ No more "dead zone" - smooth transition at single breakpoint
  - ✓ Nav bar and content always match width
- **Technical Details:**
  - All desktop transitions now happen at exactly 769px
  - Clean breakpoint: mobile ≤768px, desktop ≥769px
  - No overlapping media queries
  - Matches established app-wide desktop breakpoint
- **Investigation Process:**
  - Searched all CSS files for 1024px breakpoints
  - Identified Dashboard.module.css and StatsPanel.module.css
  - Compared nav bar vs content CSS
  - Found 255px mismatch range (769px-1023px)
  - Root cause: inconsistent breakpoint values
- **Implements:** Brief K-17b specifications (fix breakpoint mismatch)
- **Files:**
  - Modified: `src/components/Dashboard/Dashboard.module.css` (2 breakpoint changes)
  - Modified: `package.json` (v2.4.43 → v2.4.44)

### v2.4.43 - My Team as Default Screen (First in Nav) (Dec 12, 2025)
**UX IMPROVEMENT:** Made My Team the default landing screen and moved it to first position in navigation
- **Problem:** Opening the app landed on Rankings, but My Team is the most-used feature
  - Users had to click through to My Team every time they opened the app
  - My Team was in middle position (3rd of 5) in nav bar
  - Rankings as default didn't match actual usage patterns
- **Solution:** Make My Team the default screen and move it to first position in nav
- **Changes:**
  - **1. Default Tab:**
    - Changed `useState<TabType>('league')` to `useState<TabType>('myteam')` in page.tsx:20
    - App now lands on My Team when opened
    - My Team becomes the "home" screen of the app
  - **2. Nav Bar Order:**
    - Moved My Team button from 3rd position to 1st position in nav bar (page.tsx:202-208)
    - New order: My Team | Rankings | Fixtures | Stats | Settings
    - Old order: Rankings | Fixtures | My Team | Stats | Settings
    - My Team now leftmost (most prominent) position
- **Result:** Better UX with My Team as home screen
  - ✓ Opening app lands directly on My Team
  - ✓ My Team is first (leftmost) nav item
  - ✓ No extra click needed to see your team
  - ✓ Matches actual user behavior
  - ✓ My Team feels like the primary feature
- **Technical Details:**
  - Only changed page.tsx (dashboard component)
  - No CSS changes needed
  - No breaking changes to other components
- **Implements:** Brief K-18 specifications (My Team as default, first in nav)
- **Files:**
  - Modified: `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` (default tab + nav order)
  - Modified: `package.json` (v2.4.42 → v2.4.43)

### v2.4.42 - Remove Pitch Markings for Cleaner View (Dec 12, 2025)
**VISUAL SIMPLIFICATION:** Removed all pitch markings for cleaner, simpler pitch view
- **Problem:** Pitch markings (goal, boxes, arcs, circles, border) added visual clutter
  - Too many lines and elements on the pitch
  - Distracted from the player cards
  - Not essential for understanding team formation
- **Solution:** Remove all pitch markings, keep only purple gradient background and bench separator
- **Changes:**
  - **1. TSX Cleanup:**
    - Removed entire `<div className={styles.pitchMarkings}>` section from PitchView.tsx
    - Removed 8 pitch marking divs: pitchBorder, goalFrame, sixYardBox, penaltyArea, penaltySpot, penaltyArc, halfwayLine, centerCircle
    - Kept bench separator line (border-top on .bench class)
  - **2. CSS Cleanup:**
    - Commented out all pitch marking CSS classes (desktop + mobile) in PitchView.module.css
    - Marked as "REMOVED (v2.4.42)" with explanation
    - Preserved CSS in comments for potential restoration if needed
    - Kept bench border-top: 2px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.2) for separation
- **Result:** Clean, minimal pitch view
  - ✓ Purple gradient background only
  - ✓ Player cards in formation clearly visible
  - ✓ Bench separator line maintained
  - ✓ No distracting pitch lines
  - ✓ Cleaner, more modern look
  - ✓ Focus on players, not geometry
- **Note:** Max-width already correctly set to 1400px from v2.4.41
  - CSS variable --app-max-width: 1400px in globals.css
  - Applied to nav bar, content, and My Team content
  - No changes needed for max-width in this version
- **Visual Comparison:**
  - Before: Purple gradient + 8 pitch markings (border, goal, boxes, arcs, circles)
  - After: Purple gradient + bench separator only
- **Implements:** Brief K-17 specifications (remove pitch markings, max-width already correct)
- **Files:**
  - Modified: `src/components/PitchView/PitchView.tsx` (removed pitch markings div, -13 lines)
  - Modified: `src/components/PitchView/PitchView.module.css` (commented out pitch marking CSS)
  - Modified: `package.json` (v2.4.41 → v2.4.42)

### v2.4.41 - Max-Width Consistency at 1400px (Dec 12, 2025)
**LAYOUT CONSISTENCY:** Unified max-width of 1400px for all layout elements using CSS variables for consistent layout at larger screen widths
- **Problem:** Inconsistent max-widths at larger screen sizes
  - Nav bar (.tabs): 1400px
  - Content container: 1400px
  - My Team content (.myTeamContent): 600px (too narrow!)
  - Layout looked awkward at very wide viewports (1500px+)
  - Different elements had different max-widths causing visual inconsistency
- **Solution:** Use CSS variable `--app-max-width: 1400px` and apply to ALL layout elements
- **Key Changes:**
  - **1. CSS Variable Creation:**
    - Added `--app-max-width: 1400px` to `:root` selector in `globals.css`
    - Single source of truth for all max-width declarations
    - Easy to change globally if needed in future
  - **2. Nav Bar Update:**
    - Changed `.tabs` max-width from `1400px` to `var(--app-max-width)` in `dashboard.module.css`
    - Nav bar now uses CSS variable (though value stayed 1400px)
  - **3. Content Container Update:**
    - Changed `.content` max-width from `1400px` to `var(--app-max-width)` in `dashboard.module.css`
    - Content container now uses CSS variable (though value stayed 1400px)
  - **4. My Team Content Update (Key Change):**
    - Changed `.myTeamContent` max-width from `600px` to `var(--app-max-width)` in `Dashboard.module.css`
    - My Team content now grows to full 1400px width on desktop (was limited to 600px)
    - Much better use of screen space at larger viewports
- **Technical Implementation:**
  - **globals.css:**
    - Added `--app-max-width: 1400px` to existing `:root` selector
    - Placed alongside other CSS variables (--status-bar-height, --bottom-bar-height)
  - **dashboard.module.css:**
    - Updated `.tabs` in @media (min-width: 769px) to use variable
    - Updated `.content` to use variable
  - **Dashboard.module.css:**
    - Updated `.myTeamContent` in @media (min-width: 1024px) to use variable
    - Changed from 600px to 1400px via the variable
- **Result:** Consistent 1400px max-width across all layout elements
  - ✓ Nav bar, content, and My Team content all stop growing at 1400px
  - ✓ Better layout consistency at larger viewports (1500px+)
  - ✓ My Team content uses full available width (no longer constrained to 600px)
  - ✓ Single source of truth via CSS variable
  - ✓ Easy to adjust globally if needed in future
  - ✓ Professional, consistent layout at all screen sizes
- **Visual Comparison:**
  - Before: My Team content capped at 600px while nav bar and main content at 1400px
  - After: All elements consistently stop growing at 1400px
- **Implements:** Brief K-16 specifications (max-width consistency)
- **Files:**
  - Modified: `src/app/globals.css` (added CSS variable)
  - Modified: `src/app/dashboard/dashboard.module.css` (tabs and content use variable)
  - Modified: `src/components/Dashboard/Dashboard.module.css` (myTeamContent uses variable, 600px→1400px)
  - Modified: `package.json` (v2.4.40 → v2.4.41)

### v2.4.40 - Redesign Player Cards to FPL Style (Dec 12, 2025)
**VISUAL REDESIGN:** Completely redesigned player cards to match official FPL app style with compact layout and professional appearance
- **Problem:** Current player cards had several design issues
  - Too much vertical space (full jersey + name below + points below = tall cards)
  - No card container (jersey just floated with text underneath)
  - Bench missing position labels (no GKP/MID/DEF/FWD indicators)
  - Generic styling didn't match FPL app quality
- **Solution:** Implement FPL-style card design with cropped jerseys, color-coded bars, and position labels
- **Key Design Changes:**
  - **1. Card Container Structure:**
    - Added rounded card container (8px border-radius) with dark background (#1a1a2e)
    - Box shadow for depth (0 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.3))
    - Compact, square-ish cards instead of tall vertical layout
    - Better proportions matching FPL app
  - **2. Jersey Cropping (Key Feature):**
    - Fixed height kitContainer (60px desktop, 50px mobile, 54px small mobile)
    - `overflow: hidden` crops bottom of jersey to show only top 60-70%
    - `align-items: flex-start` aligns jersey to top of container
    - Natural aspect ratio maintained but bottom is cut off
    - Creates compact look without distorting jersey
  - **3. Color Scheme (FPL Official Colors):**
    - Name bar: Dark purple (#37003c) with white text - official FPL purple
    - Points bar: FPL green (#00ff87) with dark text (#1a1a2e) - official FPL green
    - Zero points: Red name bar (#dc2626) instead of purple
    - Card background: Dark navy (#1a1a2e)
    - Removed positive/negative gradient styling from points bar
  - **4. Bench Position Labels:**
    - Added GKP/DEF/MID/FWD labels above bench player cards
    - Uppercase, semi-transparent gray text (rgba(255,255,255,0.6))
    - Position mapping: 1=GKP (Goalkeeper), 2=DEF (Defender), 3=MID (Midfielder), 4=FWD (Forward)
    - New `.benchPlayerContainer` wrapper with flex column layout
    - New `.benchPosition` class for label styling
  - **5. Captain/Vice Badges Repositioned:**
    - Moved from top-center to top-left of jersey (6px from top/left)
    - Gold background (#fbbf24) for captain (C)
    - Gray background (#94a3b8) for vice-captain (V)
    - Slightly larger (18px desktop, 16px tablet, 14px mobile)
    - Box shadow for better visibility
- **Technical Implementation:**
  - **PlayerCard.module.css:**
    - Complete rewrite with FPL structure
    - Card container with rounded corners and shadow
    - Fixed-height jersey container with overflow hidden
    - Purple name bar, green points bar
    - Zero points red name bar conditional styling
    - Position label styles
    - Responsive: 70px → 60px → 64px card widths
  - **PlayerCard.tsx:**
    - Added `isZeroPoints` logic (points === 0)
    - Conditional className for red name bar on zero points
    - Removed positive/negative points styling logic
    - Updated comments for cropped jersey feature
  - **PitchView.tsx:**
    - Wrapped bench players in `.benchPlayerContainer` div
    - Added position label rendering with mapping object
    - Position labels: {1: 'GKP', 2: 'DEF', 3: 'MID', 4: 'FWD'}
    - Conditional rendering of position label if exists
  - **PitchView.module.css:**
    - Added `.benchPlayerContainer` with flex column layout
    - Added `.benchPosition` class for label styling
    - Changed `.benchRow` align-items to flex-start
    - Added mobile responsive styles for position labels
- **Result:** Professional FPL-style player cards with compact layout
  - ✓ Jersey cropped to show only top 60-70% (much more compact)
  - ✓ Card container with rounded corners and shadow
  - ✓ Dark purple name bar with white text (FPL official color)
  - ✓ FPL green points bar with dark text (FPL official color)
  - ✓ Red name bar for zero points (like FPL app)
  - ✓ Position labels on bench players (GKP, DEF, MID, FWD)
  - ✓ Captain/Vice badges on top-left of jersey with box shadow
  - ✓ Less vertical space = more compact pitch view
  - ✓ Better info density and professional appearance
  - ✓ Matches official FPL app quality and style
- **Visual Comparison:**
  - Before: Tall cards with full jersey visible, floating text
  - After: Compact square-ish cards with cropped jersey, integrated card design
- **Implements:** Brief K-15 specifications (FPL-style player cards)
- **Files:**
  - Modified: `src/components/PitchView/PlayerCard.module.css` (complete rewrite, FPL structure)
  - Modified: `src/components/PitchView/PlayerCard.tsx` (zero points logic)
  - Modified: `src/components/PitchView/PitchView.tsx` (bench position labels)
  - Modified: `src/components/PitchView/PitchView.module.css` (bench container & position label styles)

### v2.4.39 - Fix Desktop Layout with Unified Vertical Layout (Dec 12, 2025)
**LAYOUT FIX:** Fixed desktop layout breaking issues by implementing unified vertical layout for all screen sizes
- **Problem:** Desktop layout (≥1024px) broke with side-by-side design
  - Desktop showed 30% transfers panel | 70% pitch (two-column grid)
  - Missing stat boxes: GW PTS, GW RANK, TRANSFERS, TOTAL PTS, OVERALL RANK not visible on desktop
  - Missing pitch elements: Center circle and penalty arc disappeared (likely due to 70% width constraint)
  - Different GW selector style: Desktop showed "Gameweek 15" while mobile showed compact "GW 15"
  - Mobile (< 1024px) worked correctly with all elements visible
- **Solution:** Unified vertical layout for all screen sizes (Option A from Brief K-14)
  - Same layout on mobile, tablet, and desktop - just wider on larger screens
  - No separate desktop/mobile layouts - single consistent structure
  - Desktop gets max-width and centered to prevent over-stretching
- **Changes:**
  - **1. MyTeamTab.tsx - Removed Dual Layout System:**
    - Removed `.mobileLayout` wrapper div (lines 112-187)
    - Removed `.desktopLayout` div with 30%/70% grid (lines 189-225)
    - Single `.myTeamContent` wrapper for all screen sizes
    - Layout order: GW Selector → Stat Boxes (2 rows) → Pitch → Team Value → GW Transfers
    - All components visible at all screen sizes
  - **2. Dashboard.module.css - Unified Layout CSS:**
    - Removed `.mobileLayout` class and styles
    - Removed `.desktopLayout` class and 30%/70% grid styles
    - Removed `@media (min-width: 1024px)` hiding mobile layout
    - Single `.myTeamContent` with flex column layout
    - Added desktop-specific styles: `max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto`
    - Net reduction: -56 lines (67 insertions, 123 deletions)
- **Result:** Consistent layout across all devices with all elements visible
  - ✓ Desktop shows all 5 stat boxes (GW PTS, GW RANK, TRANSFERS, TOTAL PTS, OVERALL RANK)
  - ✓ Desktop shows all pitch elements (goal, boxes, penalty spot, penalty arc, halfway line, center circle)
  - ✓ Same compact GW selector style on all devices ("GW 15")
  - ✓ Consistent vertical stack layout: mobile, tablet, desktop
  - ✓ Desktop layout centered with 600px max-width to prevent over-stretching
  - ✓ GW Transfers section visible with receipt-style layout
  - ✓ All elements properly sized and visible
- **Technical Details:**
  - Removed conditional rendering based on screen size
  - Single source of truth for layout structure
  - Responsive design through max-width instead of separate layouts
  - Cleaner, more maintainable code
- **Implements:** Brief K-14 Option A (recommended solution)
- **Files:**
  - Modified: `src/components/Dashboard/MyTeamTab.tsx` (removed dual layout system)
  - Modified: `src/components/Dashboard/Dashboard.module.css` (unified layout CSS, removed desktop grid)

### v2.4.38 - Proper Pitch Geometry with True Semicircles (Dec 12, 2025)
**GEOMETRY FIX:** Implemented proper semicircular arcs with correct proportions and true geometric shapes
- **Problem:** Pitch arcs needed proper sizing and geometry
  - Center circle too small (80px wide) - not proportional to pitch size
  - Penalty arc removed in v2.4.34 - needed to be re-added with correct geometry
  - Arcs must be TRUE semicircles (height = width/2), not ovals or ellipses
  - User clarification: "circles should be half circles, not whatever you have been drawing"
- **Solution:** Re-add penalty arc and enlarge center circle as proper TRUE semicircles
- **Changes:**
  - **1. Re-added Penalty Arc as TRUE Semicircle:**
    - Desktop: `width: 180px; height: 90px` (height = width/2 for true semicircle)
    - Mobile: `width: 150px; height: 75px`
    - Curves DOWNWARD from bottom of 18-yard box: `border-radius: 0 0 90px 90px`
    - Border radius equals height (90px) for perfect circular arc
    - Positioned at `top: 145px` (25px goal + 120px penalty area)
    - Width is ~50% of penalty area width
    - Added to HTML: `<div className={styles.penaltyArc} />`
  - **2. Increased Center Circle Size as TRUE Semicircle:**
    - Desktop: `width: 150px; height: 75px` (was 80x40 - almost doubled)
    - Mobile: `width: 120px; height: 60px` (was 70x35 - proportionally larger)
    - Curves UPWARD toward goal: `border-radius: 75px 75px 0 0`
    - Border radius equals height (75px) for perfect circular arc
    - Much larger for proper pitch proportions
  - **3. TRUE Semicircle Geometry Principle:**
    - Height always equals half the width (creates true half-circle)
    - Border radius equals the height (creates proper curve)
    - Not ovals or ellipses - geometric semicircles like cutting a circle in half
    - Example: 150px wide circle cut in half = 75px tall semicircle
- **Result:** Proper football pitch geometry with correctly sized and shaped arcs
  - ✓ Penalty arc: TRUE semicircle curving DOWNWARD from 18-yard box
  - ✓ Center circle: MUCH larger TRUE semicircle curving UPWARD on halfway line
  - ✓ Both arcs use proper geometric ratios (height = width/2)
  - ✓ Border radius = height ensures perfect circular curves
  - ✓ Proportions match real football pitch layout
  - ✓ Desktop and mobile styles both use true semicircle geometry
- **Technical Note:** All semicircles maintain 1:2 height-to-width ratio with border-radius equal to height
- **Implements:** User clarification answers from pitch design specifications
- **Files:**
  - Modified: `src/components/PitchView/PitchView.tsx` (added penaltyArc div)
  - Modified: `src/components/PitchView/PitchView.module.css` (penalty arc styles, center circle size increase, desktop & mobile)

### v2.4.37 - Final Pitch Layout Following Annotated Design (Dec 12, 2025)
**LAYOUT FIX:** Implemented 5 design changes to create proper pitch layout with two borders and clear hierarchy
- **Problem:** Pitch layout needed refinement based on annotated design specifications
  - Container needed standard border like other app containers
  - Pitch border too close to container edge (only 10px margin)
  - Penalty area floating in center (75% width), should connect to pitch sides
  - Halfway line cutting through forwards, should mark bottom of pitch
  - Bench inside pitch area, should be clearly OUTSIDE
- **Solution:** Implement 5 specific changes from Brief K-13d-v8 annotated design
- **Changes:**
  - **1. Re-added Container Border:** Added standard border to `.pitch` container: `1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)`
  - **2. Increased Pitch Border Margins:**
    - Desktop: `top/left/right: 10px → 20px`, `bottom: 90px → 140px`
    - Mobile: `top/left/right: 8px → 15px`, `bottom: 70px → 100px`
    - More space between pitch border and container creates clear visual separation
  - **3. Connected Penalty Area to Pitch Border Sides:**
    - Desktop: Changed from `width: 75%` centered to `left: 20px; right: 20px`
    - Mobile: Changed from `width: 70%` centered to `left: 15px; right: 15px`
    - 18-yard box now TOUCHES pitch border on both sides like real pitch
  - **4. Moved Halfway Line to Bottom of Pitch Border:**
    - Desktop: `bottom: 100px → 140px`, added `left: 20px; right: 20px` alignment
    - Mobile: `bottom: 75px → 100px`, added `left: 15px; right: 15px` alignment
    - Halfway line = bottom edge of pitch border (where pitch ends)
  - **5. All Elements Adjusted for New Layout:**
    - Center circle moved to new halfway line position (bottom: 140px desktop, 100px mobile)
    - Goal frame, 6-yard box, penalty spot maintain positions relative to top
    - Bench now clearly OUTSIDE pitch area (below halfway line)
- **Result:** Clear visual hierarchy matching annotated design
  - ✓ Two distinct borders: container border (purple/rounded) + pitch border (white rectangle inside)
  - ✓ 20px gap between container and pitch border on desktop (15px mobile)
  - ✓ Penalty area spans full width, side lines connect to pitch border
  - ✓ Halfway line marks bottom of pitch where it ends
  - ✓ Bench positioned clearly OUTSIDE the pitch rectangle
  - ✓ Forwards (Haaland, etc.) positioned INSIDE pitch, ABOVE halfway line
  - ✓ Center circle sits on halfway line at bottom of pitch
- **Visual Layout:** Matches user's annotated drawing exactly
- **Implements:** Brief K-13d-v8 specifications
- **Files:**
  - Modified: `src/components/PitchView/PitchView.module.css` (container border, pitch border margins, penalty area positioning, halfway line/center circle positions, mobile styles)

### v2.4.36 - Convert Pitch Border from CSS Border to Drawn Element (Dec 12, 2025)
**CORRECTION:** Fixed pitch border implementation - converted from CSS border on container to drawn rectangle element inside
- **Problem:** v2.4.35 incorrectly added CSS border directly to .pitch container
  - Used `border: 2px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.25)` on container element
  - This created a container border, not a pitch marking drawn inside
  - User explicitly corrected: "You added a thick border to the container. That's WRONG."
  - Pitch markings should be drawn INSIDE container like all other markings (goal, penalty box, etc.)
- **Solution:** Convert pitch border to drawn rectangle element positioned inside container
- **Changes:**
  - **Pitch Container (`PitchView.module.css`):** Removed CSS border from `.pitch` container
  - **HTML (`PitchView.tsx`):** Added `<div className={styles.pitchBorder} />` element to pitch markings
  - **CSS (`PitchView.module.css`):** Added `.pitchBorder` class with absolute positioning
    - Desktop: `top: 10px; left: 10px; right: 10px; bottom: 90px` (stops above bench)
    - Mobile: `top: 8px; left: 8px; right: 8px; bottom: 70px` (stops above mobile bench)
    - Border: `1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.25)`
    - Border radius: `4px`
    - Z-index: `0` (behind other markings)
    - Pointer events: `none` (doesn't block player clicks)
- **Result:** Pitch border now correctly renders as drawn rectangle INSIDE container
  - ✓ Border is drawn element positioned absolutely within pitch container
  - ✓ Stops above bench area (doesn't extend to container edges)
  - ✓ Matches style of other pitch markings (goal frame, penalty area, etc.)
  - ✓ Z-index 0 ensures it renders behind other pitch elements
  - ✓ 4px border radius provides subtle corner smoothing
- **Implements:** Brief K-13d-v7 specifications
- **Files:**
  - Modified: `src/components/PitchView/PitchView.tsx` (added pitchBorder HTML element)
  - Modified: `src/components/PitchView/PitchView.module.css` (removed CSS border from container, added pitchBorder class for desktop & mobile)

### v2.4.35 - Add Pitch Border and Fix Center Circle Direction (Dec 12, 2025)
**VISUAL FIX:** Added visible pitch border and corrected center circle to curve upward toward goal
- **Problem:** Two geometry issues needed correction
  - No visible border around pitch container - pitch blended into background
  - Center circle curving DOWNWARD instead of UPWARD toward goal
  - Center circle had `border-radius: 0 0 50% 50%` (curves bottom) and `border-top: none`
- **Solution:** Add pitch border and fix center circle curvature
- **Changes:**
  - **Pitch Border (`PitchView.module.css`):**
    - Changed `.pitch` border from `1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)` → `2px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.25)`
    - More prominent border (2px instead of 1px, 0.25 opacity instead of 0.1)
    - Clearly defines pitch playing area
  - **Center Circle - Desktop:**
    - `border-radius: 0 0 50% 50%` → `border-radius: 50% 50% 0 0` (curves UPWARD)
    - `border-top: none` → `border-bottom: none` (flat edge on halfway line)
    - Enhanced comment: "curves UPWARD toward goal"
  - **Center Circle - Mobile:**
    - Added `border-radius: 50% 50% 0 0` (was missing explicit value)
    - Added `border-bottom: none` (was missing)
- **Result:** Pitch now has clear visible boundary and center circle correctly curves upward
  - ✓ Pitch border clearly visible and defines playing area
  - ✓ Center circle curves UPWARD like real football pitch
  - ✓ Flat edge of center circle aligns with halfway line
  - ✓ Consistent geometry across desktop and mobile
- **Implements:** Brief K-13d-v6 specifications
- **Files:**
  - Modified: `src/components/PitchView/PitchView.module.css` (pitch border, center circle curvature for desktop & mobile)

### v2.4.34 - Remove Penalty Arc for Cleaner Pitch View (Dec 12, 2025)
**SIMPLIFICATION:** Removed penalty arc element completely to simplify pitch markings
- **Problem:** Penalty arc was problematic despite multiple positioning attempts
  - Initial implementation had arc in wrong position
  - v2.4.32-v2.4.33 attempts to fix positioning and geometry
  - Arc proved difficult to position correctly and visually match reference
- **Solution:** Remove penalty arc completely - it's a nice-to-have, not essential
- **Changes:**
  - **HTML (`PitchView.tsx`):** Removed `<div className={styles.penaltyArc} />` element
  - **CSS (`PitchView.module.css`):** Removed `.penaltyArc` class from both desktop and mobile sections
  - Updated element numbering: 5. Halfway Line, 6. Center Circle (was 6. and 7.)
  - Updated comment: "6 essential elements" (was 7)
- **Result:** Cleaner, simpler pitch with 6 essential elements
  - ✓ Goal frame
  - ✓ 6-yard box
  - ✓ 18-yard box (penalty area)
  - ✓ Penalty spot
  - ✓ Halfway line
  - ✓ Center circle
- **Justification:** FPL app's penalty arc is also very subtle/minimal in their official design
- **Future:** Can add penalty arc back later once other elements look perfect
- **Files:**
  - Modified: `src/components/PitchView/PitchView.tsx` (removed penalty arc div)
  - Modified: `src/components/PitchView/PitchView.module.css` (removed penalty arc CSS, updated comments)

### v2.4.33 - Correct Penalty Spot Geometry and Enhance Pitch Comments (Dec 12, 2025)
**ACCURACY FIX:** Corrected penalty spot position to accurate 12-yard distance with detailed geometry documentation
- **Problem:** Penalty spot positioned slightly too high (100px desktop, 80px mobile)
  - Should be exactly 12 yards from goal line, which is 12/18 (66.67%) of penalty area depth
  - Current positioning was approximately 62.5% of penalty area depth
  - Brief K-13d-v4 flagged geometry concerns
- **Solution:** Corrected penalty spot position with precise calculations
- **Desktop Changes:**
  - Penalty spot: `100px → 105px` (25px goal + 80px where 80 = 12/18 × 120px penalty area)
  - Calculation: 25 + (12/18 × 120) = 25 + 80 = **105px** ✓
- **Mobile Changes:**
  - Penalty spot: `80px → 83px` (20px goal + 63px where 63 = 12/18 × 95px penalty area)
  - Calculation: 20 + (12/18 × 95) = 20 + 63 = **83px** ✓
- **Enhanced Documentation:**
  - Added explicit inline geometry calculations in CSS comments
  - Clarified penalty area starts at goal line (after goal frame)
  - Clarified penalty arc sits at BOTTOM EDGE of 18-yard box and curves DOWNWARD into field
  - Added "D" shape description for penalty arc
- **Verified Correct Layout:**
  - ✓ Penalty spot is ABOVE the arc (105px < 145px desktop, 83px < 115px mobile)
  - ✓ Penalty spot is INSIDE the penalty box (between 25-145px desktop, 20-115px mobile)
  - ✓ Penalty arc at exact bottom edge of 18-yard box
  - ✓ Arc curves downward away from goal (like letter "D" rotated 90°)
- **Result:** Pitch markings now geometrically accurate to real football pitch proportions
- **Files:**
  - Modified: `src/components/PitchView/PitchView.module.css` (corrected penalty spot position, enhanced comments for desktop & mobile)

### v2.4.32 - Explicit Pitch Markings with Standardized Structure (Dec 12, 2025)
**REFACTOR:** Complete overhaul of pitch markings implementation with explicit specifications and standardized class names
- **Problem:** Previous pitch marking implementation had inconsistent naming and could be improved
  - Class names had suffixes like "Top", "Bottom" that were confusing (`.penaltyBoxTop`, `.goalAreaTop`)
  - Corner arcs included but not relevant for half-pitch view
  - Goal frame used compound classes (`.goalFrame.top`)
  - Implementation could benefit from clearer structure
- **Solution:** Implement exact pitch markings specification with standardized class names
- **Changes:**
  - **HTML Structure (`PitchView.tsx`):**
    - Simplified to exactly 7 marking elements (no corner arcs)
    - Standardized class names: `.goalFrame`, `.sixYardBox`, `.penaltyArea`, `.penaltySpot`, `.penaltyArc`, `.halfwayLine`, `.centerCircle`
    - Removed compound classes and "Top" suffixes
    - Self-closing JSX tags for cleaner code
  - **CSS Implementation (`PitchView.module.css`):**
    - Complete rewrite of pitch markings section with exact specifications
    - All 7 elements with clear numeric comments (1. Goal Frame, 2. Six-Yard Box, etc.)
    - Opacity values meet visibility requirements: goal frame 0.3, penalty spot 0.35, halfway line 0.3, others 0.25
    - Sizing: goal 100px×25px, 6-yard 160px×40px, penalty area 75% width×120px height
    - Updated mobile responsive styles to match new class names
  - **Code Quality:**
    - Reduced total lines (134 removed, 87 added = -47 net lines)
    - Better maintainability with standardized naming
    - Clear documentation in comments
- **7 Required Elements Verified:**
  - ✓ Goal frame (100px wide, 25px high, 0.3 opacity)
  - ✓ Six-yard box (160px wide, 40px high, 0.25 opacity)
  - ✓ Penalty area (75% wide, 120px high, 0.25 opacity)
  - ✓ Penalty spot (8px diameter, 0.35 opacity)
  - ✓ Penalty arc (100px wide, 50px high, 0.25 opacity)
  - ✓ Halfway line (90% width, 0.3 opacity)
  - ✓ Center circle (80px wide, 40px high, 0.25 opacity)
- **Result:** Cleaner, more maintainable pitch markings with standardized naming and exact specifications
- **Files:**
  - Modified: `src/components/PitchView/PitchView.tsx` (simplified HTML structure)
  - Modified: `src/components/PitchView/PitchView.module.css` (complete rewrite of markings section, updated mobile styles)

### v2.4.31 - Enhance Pitch Markings Visibility (Dec 12, 2025)
**VISUAL FIX:** Increased opacity of all pitch markings to make pitch more recognizable as football field
- **Problem:** Pitch markings too subtle (0.12-0.15 opacity) - barely visible, doesn't visually read as football pitch
  - Penalty boxes, goal area, arcs, lines all at `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.12)` (too faint)
  - Penalty spot at `0.15` opacity (hard to see)
  - Goal frame at `0.25` border opacity (too subtle)
  - Net pattern at `0.06` opacity (almost invisible)
  - Overall pitch felt like generic purple container, not football field
- **Solution:** Enhanced markings by increasing opacity ~2x for better visibility while keeping brand colors
- **Opacity Changes (Desktop & Mobile):**
  - Penalty box (18-yard): `border: 0.12 → 0.25` (doubled)
  - 6-yard box (goal area): `border: 0.12 → 0.25` (doubled)
  - Penalty spot: `background: 0.15 → 0.3` (doubled), size `5px → 6px` (slightly larger)
  - Penalty arc: `border: 0.12 → 0.25` (doubled)
  - Halfway line: `background: 0.12 → 0.25` (doubled)
  - Center mark: `border: 0.12 → 0.25` (doubled)
  - Goal frame: `border: 0.25 → 0.35`, `background: 0.25 → 0.3` (more prominent)
  - Net pattern: `0.06 → 0.08` (more visible)
- **Result:** Pitch now immediately recognizable as football field at a glance
  - Markings visible but not overpowering
  - Purple gradient background maintained for brand consistency
  - Better visual hierarchy: goal, penalty area, and halfway line stand out
  - Professional football pitch appearance without changing colors
- **Files:**
  - Modified: `src/components/PitchView/PitchView.module.css` (enhanced all marking opacities, desktop & mobile)

### v2.4.30 - GW Transfers Receipt-Style Layout (Dec 12, 2025)
**STYLING FIX:** Transform GW Transfers section into clean receipt/ledger format with clear hierarchy
- **Problem:** Title too small and not bold, transferred-out players gray instead of white, hit cost buried in awkward summary text
  - Title was 0.85rem and font-weight 600 (too subtle)
  - Player out names were `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7)` (gray, hard to read)
  - Hit cost hidden in summary line: "Net: +15 pts (after -4 hit: +11 pts)"
  - Summary layout awkward and hard to scan
- **Solution:** Receipt-style layout with proper visual hierarchy and clear line items
- **JSX Changes (`StatsPanel.tsx`):**
  - Changed title from `<div>` to `<h3>` for semantic markup
  - Separated hit as dedicated row that only shows if `gwTransfers.cost > 0`
  - Added `<hr className={styles.transferSeparator} />` before net result
  - Net result now dedicated row with left label ("Net result:") and right value
  - Renamed CSS class from `transferDiff` to `transferPointsDiff` for clarity
- **CSS Changes (`StatsPanel.module.css`):**
  - **Title:** `font-size: 0.85rem → 1rem`, `font-weight: 600 → 700` (bigger, bolder)
  - **Player out:** `color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7) → #ffffff` (WHITE, not gray) + `font-weight: 500`
  - **Hit row:** New styles - `display: flex`, `justify-content: space-between`, red value (`#ff4757`)
  - **Separator:** `border-top: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15)` (subtle line)
  - **Net result:** New dedicated row styles with larger font (`1.1rem`), bold (`700`)
  - **Point diff:** Renamed from `.transferDiff` to `.transferPointsDiff`, `font-weight: 700 → 600`
- **Visual Result (Receipt Style):**
  ```
  GW15 TRANSFERS                                  ← Bigger, BOLD

  Mateta (2pts)      →   Thiago (2pts)        0  ← WHITE "Mateta"
  Semenyo (3pts)     →   B.Fernandes (18pts) +15 ← WHITE "Semenyo"
  Hit                                         -4  ← Separate line, RED
                                         ───────  ← Separator
  Net result:                            +11 pts  ← Clear label + value
  ```
- **Files:**
  - Modified: `src/components/PitchView/StatsPanel.tsx` (new JSX structure)
  - Modified: `src/components/PitchView/StatsPanel.module.css` (receipt-style formatting)

### v2.4.29 - Spread Players Wider on Pitch (Dec 12, 2025)
**LAYOUT FIX:** Players now spread across more of the pitch width for a natural formation feel
- **Problem:** Players clustered in center of pitch using only ~70% of available width
  - `justify-content: center` kept players tightly grouped in middle
  - Unused space on left and right edges of pitch
  - Formation felt cramped and unnatural
  - Gap between players was `0.6rem` with no edge padding
- **Solution:** Changed flexbox distribution from center to space-evenly for better horizontal spread
- **Changes to Desktop (`PitchView.module.css`):**
  - `.pitchRow`: Changed `justify-content: center → space-evenly` (distribute across width)
  - `.pitchRow`: Reduced `gap: 0.6rem → 0.5rem` (tighter gaps between players)
  - `.pitchRow`: Added `padding: 0 8px` (small edge buffer so players don't touch container edges)
  - `.benchRow`: Changed `justify-content: center → space-evenly` (match pitch rows)
  - `.benchRow`: Reduced `gap: 0.6rem → 0.5rem`, added `padding: 0 8px`
- **Changes to Mobile:**
  - `.pitchRow`: Reduced `gap: 0.4rem → 0.35rem`, added `padding: 0 6px`
  - `.benchRow`: Reduced `gap: 0.4rem → 0.35rem`, added `padding: 0 6px`
- **Result:** Players now spread across ~85-95% of pitch width with natural spacing
  - Defenders, midfielders, forwards utilize more horizontal space
  - GK remains centered (only 1 player)
  - Better use of available space without feeling cramped
  - Formation looks more like real football pitch
- **Files:**
  - Modified: `src/components/PitchView/PitchView.module.css` (updated flexbox distribution and spacing)

### v2.4.28 - Reformat Hit Display in Transfers Stat Box (Dec 12, 2025)
**LAYOUT FIX:** Hit cost now displays inline with transfer count for cleaner, balanced stat box
- **Problem:** Hit cost (-4) displayed below "TRANSFERS" label, making stat box taller and unbalanced
  - Current layout stacked: "2 / TRANSFERS / (-4)"
  - Stat box was taller than others due to extra line
  - Hit cost as separate div with margin-top creating awkward spacing
- **Solution:** Move hit cost inline with transfer count using flexbox
- **JSX Changes (`MyTeamTab.tsx`):**
  - Moved hit cost span inside statBoxValue div instead of as separate sibling
  - Changed from `<div className={styles.statBoxSub}>` to `<span className={styles.statBoxSub}>`
  - Added space before parenthesis for proper formatting: `{' (-'}{gwTransfers.cost}{')'}`
- **CSS Changes (`Dashboard.module.css`):**
  - Updated `.statBoxValue`: Added `display: flex`, `align-items: baseline`, `justify-content: center`, `gap: 4px`
  - Updated `.statBoxSub`: Changed `font-size: 0.7rem → 0.9rem`, `color: #ef4444 → #ff4757` (app red), removed `margin-top`
- **Result:** Cleaner, more balanced layout - "2 (-4)" displays on one line, "TRANSFERS" below
- **Visual Comparison:**
  - Before: "2 / TRANSFERS / (-4)" (stacked, unbalanced)
  - After: "2 (-4) / TRANSFERS" (inline, balanced)
- **Files:**
  - Modified: `src/components/Dashboard/MyTeamTab.tsx` (moved hit cost inline)
  - Modified: `src/components/Dashboard/Dashboard.module.css` (flexbox layout for inline display)

### v2.4.27 - Update GW Transfers Styling to Match App Branding (Dec 12, 2025)
**STYLING FIX:** GW Transfers now uses app's color palette for visual consistency
- **Problem:** GW Transfers container colors didn't match app branding
  - Using teal (#10b981) instead of app's green (#00ff87)
  - Text not white enough (opacity too low)
  - Overall felt inconsistent with other containers (points badges, GW selector, etc.)
- **Solution:** Updated all colors to match app's established palette
- **Color Updates:**
  - Title color: #10b981 → #00ff87 (app green)
  - Player In color: #10b981 → #00ff87 + font-weight: 500
  - Positive diff: #10b981 → #00ff87
  - Negative diff: #ef4444 → #ff4757 (app red)
  - Transfer Out: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6) → 0.7 (brighter)
  - Transfer Arrow: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3) → 0.4 (brighter)
  - Transfer Points: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4) → 0.5 (brighter)
  - Summary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5) → 0.6 (brighter)
- **Typography Improvements:**
  - Letter spacing: 0.05em → 0.5px (more precise)
  - Font sizes optimized: 0.8rem → 0.85rem for summary
  - Added margin to transfer arrow: 0 8px (better spacing)
  - Border opacity: 0.06 → 0.1 (more visible)
- **Result:** GW Transfers now visually consistent with rest of app
  - Green highlights match GW selector hover, points badges, etc.
  - Red accents match app's error/negative color
  - Text more readable with improved opacity levels
- **Files:**
  - Modified: `src/components/PitchView/StatsPanel.module.css` (updated all transfer-related colors and typography)

### v2.4.26 - Make GW Transfers Dynamic (Dec 12, 2025)
**FUNCTIONALITY FIX:** GW Transfers section now updates dynamically when navigating gameweeks
- **Problem:** GW Transfers section stayed fixed on current GW (e.g., "GW15 TRANSFERS") regardless of selected GW
  - Transfers API endpoint hardcoded to fetch only current GW transfers
  - StatsPanel component didn't pass selected GW to transfers endpoint
  - Navigating to GW14 still showed "GW15 TRANSFERS" with GW15 data
- **Solution:** Made transfers API accept gameweek query parameter and updated component to pass it
- **API Changes (`/api/team/[teamId]/transfers/route.ts`):**
  - Added `gw` query parameter support (e.g., `?gw=14`)
  - Falls back to current GW if no query param provided (backward compatible)
  - Replaced hardcoded `currentGW` with dynamic `targetGW` based on query param
  - Fetch player points from live data (`/api/event/${targetGW}/live/`) for accurate historical GW points
  - Filter transfers by `targetGW` instead of always using current GW
  - Fallback to bootstrap data if live data unavailable (for very old GWs)
- **Component Changes (`StatsPanel.tsx`):**
  - Updated transfers fetch to include `?gw=${selectedGW}` query parameter
  - Transfers now re-fetch automatically when selectedGW changes (already in useEffect deps)
  - Display updates with correct GW number and transfer data
- **Result:** Navigating gameweeks now shows correct transfers for each GW
  - GW15 selected → Shows "GW15 TRANSFERS" with GW15 transfers and points
  - GW14 selected → Shows "GW14 TRANSFERS" with GW14 transfers and points
  - GW1 selected → Shows nothing (no transfers possible first week)
  - GW with no transfers → Section hidden (no transfers made that week)
- **Files:**
  - Modified: `src/app/api/team/[teamId]/transfers/route.ts` (added GW parameter support, live data fetching)
  - Modified: `src/components/PitchView/StatsPanel.tsx` (pass selectedGW to API)
